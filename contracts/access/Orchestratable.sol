 * be marked with the `onlyOrchestrated` modifier.
 *
 * During deployment, the contract deployer (`conductor`) can register any contracts that have privileged access
 * by calling `orchestrate`.
 *
 * Once deployment is completed, `conductor` should call `transferConductor(address(0x00))` to avoid any more contracts
 * ever gaining privileged access.
